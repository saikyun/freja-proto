observation: it was super boring
why:
- perfect information
  -> too easy
- too little to do





solution:
- perfect information
  -> randomness
    -> where they walk
    -> chance to notice me
  -> add more mechanics which interact with each other
    -> brightness



- one could add exploration

NEXT STEP:
- make glutton person walk to the study sometimes

- the glutton walks between:
  - kitchen
  - study
  - toilet

observation: immediately more exciting -- it could be more exciting
but when being found, it was very boring
why:
- no choice when moving, just ran to ladder
  -> no planning
  - both have same movement speed all the time
- when being seen, 0 tension to max tension




solution:
- fight or flee
- sneak / running
- step wise danger increase
  - safe mode
  - hear something
    -> cautious / observative
  - see player
    -> chase mode
  - lost sight of player
    -> active search mode
- re-hiding
