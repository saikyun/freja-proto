# Progress

- made paper prototype of combat system
  - works OK

- made paper protoype of stealth
  - evoked emotions of tension and fear
- implementing
  1.
  - design a map
  - have enemies walk around
  - try to see where they go
  2.
  - adding randomness to how they walked






---


observation: it was super boring
why:
- perfect information
  -> too easy
- too little to do





solution:
- perfect information
  -> randomness
    -> where they walk
    -> chance to notice me
  -> add more mechanics which interact with each other
    -> brightness

- one could add exploration

NEXT STEP:
- make glutton person walk to the study sometimes

- the glutton walks between:
  - kitchen
  - study
  - toilet

observation: immediately more exciting -- it could be more exciting
but when being found, it was very boring
why:
- no choice when moving, just ran to ladder
  -> no planning
  - both have same movement speed all the time
- when being seen, 0 tension to max tension




solution:
- fight or flee
- sneak / running
- step wise danger increase
  - safe mode
  - hear something
    -> cautious / observative
  - see player
    -> chase mode
  - lost sight of player
    -> active search mode
- re-hiding

TRYING: both brightness & random walking around
feeling like I have no control
not much planning
- a little bit by choosing to go in the dark or not

Problems:
1. too easy to immediately lose
  - die roll for live / die feels too harsh
2. stretches where it doesn't feel exciting
3. too random walking around
4. too little control / few options


Solutions:

1. - elevating threat level
   - getting a chance to escape
     - thanks to elevated threat level
   - entering combat
2. - find (optional) stuff on map
   - put traps in places
   - enchant food
   - elevating threat level
   - adding fog of war
3. make them say where they are going before they go
4. - run = more movement
   - sneak = harder to find


WHAT WE HAVE NOW
- semi-random enemy movement
- brightness which increase chance of being seen
- sneak / run = short silent movement vs long loud movement

Problem
- Need to test on player

Solutions
- Implement the whole game and try it yourself
  - Implement random generated maps
- Find someone to play it
  - IRL
  - Screen share
- Game playable over network
  - Obvious problem: more coding

NICE TO HAVE
- Planting traps / enchanting things



STARTED DOING
- functions to query hexagons
  - distance
- for the purpose of creating fog of war
